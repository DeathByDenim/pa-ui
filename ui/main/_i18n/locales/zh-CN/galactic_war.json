The only thing in their way was Alenquer. General Dyal, Supreme Commander of Progenitor Coalition forces, chose to make his stand in the Alenquer system.  With just 250,000 Marines and twenty-three merchant and transport vessels, Dyal held the system for eighteen months using hit and run guerrilla tactics against the Xziphid, who had never faced such an enemy. Finally, Dyal was ordered to withdraw, having bought the Progenitor Coalition enough time to build up their forces in neighboring systems.

    "The acts of bravery and heroism displayed by Progenitor Coalition military in the Oterma System during the Century War against the Xziphid Hegemony was so great that the highest medal awarded by the military was named after the system. Oterma was considered a home for orphans- children who had lost families due to the war. Children from all across the Progenitor Coalition were sent to the system where they would be well cared for until suitable parents could be found. In a totally unexpected move, Xziphid forces appeared in the system, well beyond the established front lines, in an effort to lower Progenitor morale by striking at their most precious commodity: their children. At the time of the attack, the 17th Mars Division had happened be passing through Oterma on their way to the front lines. When they realized what was happening, they quickly moved to fortify and protect the system. In her famous book Angels of Oterma, author Elisabeth Kendrick tells stories of how the Marines of the 17th held off the Xziphid, who outnumbered them ten to one, and kept the children out of harm\\'s way until Progenitor reinforcements arrived two weeks later. Out of the ten thousand personnel in the 17th, just three thousand remained at the end of the siege. The 17th Mars would go on to become the most decorated division of the Century War.": {

        "message": "Two evenly matched forces squared off in Espenak during the Pro-Com War. The Machine Liberation Army (MLA), having gained control of the system some three months earlier, found themselves the target of a vicious counterattack led by Progenitor Coalition Loyalist Commanders. After three weeks of heavy fighting the Loyalist-led Progenitor forces prevailed and drove the MLA from the system. Six years later the system would fall into MLA hands once again, never to be reclaimed by the Progenitors."
