Twenty years before the outset of the Century War the governor of Shoujing declared a state of emergency as years of animosity between the two factions turned into open conflict. Before Progenitor Marines could arrive to quell the unrest, both factions had launched massive nuclear missile strikes against one another. In just a few moments, over seven hundred million were dead. The Progenitor Coalition moved the survivors out of the system and resettled them throughout Progenitor governed space."
